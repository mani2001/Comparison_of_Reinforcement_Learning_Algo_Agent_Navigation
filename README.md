# Agent Navigation using reinforcement algorithms (comparative study)

The objective of this project is to understand different reinforcement learning algorithms for the use case of agent navigation.

## Preface

To make this comparative study and also understand these algorithms we have chosen to take a 2-dimensional input by feeding a random matrix/tensor with obstacles.
The algorithms we have used are:
<br>
<b>1) Q-Learning </b>

<b>2)SARSA</b>

<b>3) Deep Q-networks</b>

We have also made a comparative study to understand the benefits of each of these algorithms and their potential use case scenerios.
